            In small pot, we need to add butter, honey, plum jam, cocoa, 
            gingerbread seasoning
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            We need to mix everything over low heat, to melt the butter
            and make one. Dont boil ingredients, if butter melts, just 
            turn off everything and cool it down. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Next we need another small pot. We have to add milk and sugar 
            inside. We need to melt sugar in milk, again not boil. After 
            procedure we need to cool it.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Then in bowl we need to sieve flour and mix it with baking soda.
            Now we have to add colled milk and first mass and with eggs we 
            mix everything with mixer.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            <!-- &deg is symbol for degrees celcius -->
            Now we need a form i use 11x30 cm, spread with butter, then i 
            lined it with paper. We need to bake with top/down function 
            with 170&deg;C. After 40 min we need to check on cake
            until i think max 45 min.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            We can make glaze with chocolate and cream. Additionally we can 
            add jam in the middle. And dont forget about nuts.
